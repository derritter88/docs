# Double puppeting
By giving the bridge access to your Matrix account, you can replace the Matrix
ghost of your remote account. When you do so, messages that you send from other
clients will be sent from your real Matrix account instead of the default ghost
user. In most of the bridges, this is necessary to bridge DMs you send from
other clients to Matrix.

Benefits of double puppeting:

* Automatically accept invites to new chats.
* Bridge messages you send from the native app in direct chats.
* Bridge messages you send from the native app as your Matrix real user instead
  of the bridge's ghost user.
* Optionally sync some details like low priority, favorites, mute status
  and [direct chat status](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/general/troubleshooting.html#why-are-direct-messages-showing-up-under-rooms-instead-of-people).

## Automatically
Instead of requiring everyone to manually enable double puppeting, you can give
the bridge access to enable double puppeting automatically. This makes the
process much smoother for users, and removes problems like access tokens
getting invalidated.

Previously there were multiple different automatic double puppeting methods,
but the older methods are deprecated and were completely removed in the
megabridge rewrites. Only the new appservice method is now supported.

Automatic double puppeting should work on all homeserver implementations that
support appservices. However, some servers don't follow the spec, and may not
work with a null `url` field.

Using appservices means it requires administrator access to the homeserver, so
it can't be used if your account is on someone elses server (e.g. using
self-hosted bridges from matrix.org). In such cases, manual login is the only
option.

This method also makes timestamp massaging work correctly and disables
ratelimiting for double puppeted messages.

1. First create a new appservice registration file. The name doesn't really
   matter, but `doublepuppet.yaml` is a good choice. Don't touch the bridge's
   main registration file, and make sure the ID and as/hs tokens are different
   (having multiple appservices with the same ID or as_token isn't allowed).

   ```yaml
   # The ID doesn't really matter, put whatever you want.
   id: doublepuppet
   # The URL is intentionally left empty (null), as the homeserver shouldn't
   # push events anywhere for this extra appservice. If you use a
   # non-spec-compliant server, you may need to put some fake URL here.
   url:
   # Generate random strings for these three fields. Only the as_token really
   # matters, hs_token is never used because there's no url, and the default
   # user (sender_localpart) is never used either.
   as_token: random string
   hs_token: random string
   sender_localpart: random string
   # Bridges don't like ratelimiting. This should only apply when using the
   # as_token, normal user tokens will still be ratelimited.
   rate_limited: false
   namespaces:
     users:
     # Replace your\.domain with your server name (escape dots for regex)
     - regex: '@.*:your\.domain'
       # This must be false so the appservice doesn't take over all users completely.
       exclusive: false
   ```
2. Install the new registration file the usual way
   (see [Registering appservices]).
3. Finally set `as_token:$TOKEN` as the secret in `double_puppet` -> `secrets`
   (e.g. if you have `as_token: meow` in the registration, set `as_token:meow`
   in the bridge config).
   ```yaml
   double_puppet:
     ...
     secrets:
       your.domain: "as_token:meow"
     ...
   ```
   **N.B.** For old bridges, the map is `bridge` -> `login_shared_secret_map`.

If you set up double puppeting for multiple bridges, you can safely reuse the
same registration by just setting the same token in the config of each bridge
(i.e. no need to create a new double puppeting registration for each bridge).

This method works for other homeservers too, you just have to create a new
registration file for each server, add the token to `secrets`, and also add
the server address to the `servers` map (for the bridge server, adding to the
server map is not necessary as it defaults to using the one configured in
`homeserver` -> `address`).

## Manually
Double puppeting with the manual method can only be enabled after logging into
the bridge. As with the normal login, you must do this in a private chat with
the bridge bot.

Automatic double puppeting is recommended. This method is mostly a fallback in
case your account is on a different server where you can't use automatic double
puppeting.

**N.B.** This method is not currently supported in mautrix-imessage.

1. Log in on the homeserver to get an access token, for example with the command
   ```shell
   $ curl -XPOST -d '{"type":"m.login.password","identifier":{"type": "m.id.user", "user": "example"},"password":"wordpass","initial_device_display_name":"a fancy bridge"}' https://example.com/_matrix/client/v3/login
   ```
   You may want to change the `initial_device_display_name` field to something
   more descriptive, or rename it from another client after logging in.
   * In the past, getting a token from an existing client like Element was the
     recommended easy way. However, multiple clients using the same token can
     cause issues with encryption, so doing that is no longer allowed.
2. Send `login-matrix <access token>` to the bridge bot. For the Telegram
   bridge, send `login-matrix` without the access token, then send the access
   token in a separate message.
3. After logging in, the default Matrix ghost of your remote account should
   leave rooms and your account should join all rooms the ghost was in
   automatically.

### Manually with SSO

If you only have SSO login on your homeserver, the above example with password
login won't work. However, doing SSO login manually is still possible, just a
bit more work.

1. Open `https://example.com/_matrix/client/v3/login/sso/redirect?redirectUrl=http://localhost:12345`
   in a browser. The redirect URL at the end doesn't have to be a real server,
   since you can just copy the relevant value in the browser URL bar after the
   redirect.
2. Go through the SSO process, then once it redirects to localhost:12345, copy
   the value of the `loginToken` query parameter.
3. Log into the homeserver with the login token:
   ```shell
   $ curl -XPOST -d '{"type":"m.login.token","token":"THE TOKEN","initial_device_display_name":"a fancy bridge"}' https://example.com/_matrix/client/v3/login
   ```
4. Follow steps 2 and 3 of the normal password login instructions.
