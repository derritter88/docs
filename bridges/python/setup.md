# Python bridge setup

{{ #include ../selector.html }}

This page contains instructions for setting up the bridge in a virtualenv.
You may also want to look at other ways to run the bridge:

* [Docker](../general/docker-setup.md)
* <span class="bridge-filter" bridges="telegram"></span> YunoHost:
  <a href="https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/mautrix_telegram_ynh">mautrix_telegram_ynh<span class="bridge-filter" bridges="telegram">,</span></a>
* [systemd service](#systemd-service) (at the bottom of this page)

Please note that everything in these docs are meant for server admins who want
to self-host the bridge. If you're just looking to use the bridges, check out
[Beeper], which provides fully managed instances of all of these bridges.

If you need help with setting up the bridge, you can ask in the Matrix room:
[#$bridge:maunium.net](https://matrix.to/#/#$bridge:maunium.net). For help with
setting up other parts like the homeserver that aren't the bridge, refer to
their documentation to find support rooms.

## Requirements
* Python 3.10 or higher with `pip` and `virtualenv`.
* A Matrix homeserver that supports application services (e.g. [Synapse](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse)).
  You need access to register an appservice, which usually involves editing the homeserver config file.
* A PostgreSQL server, v10 or higher (which you should already have for Synapse).
  * Make sure you don't share databases between unrelated programs.
    Shared postgres instance is fine, but shared database is not.
* If installing optional dependencies, see the [optional dependencies](./optional-dependencies.md) page.
* <span class="bridge-filter" bridges="telegram">**mautrix-telegram**: </span>
  Telegram app ID and hash (get from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org/apps)).
* <span class="bridge-filter" bridges="telegram">**mautrix-telegram**: </span>
  [LottieConverter](https://github.com/sot-tech/LottieConverter) if you want
  animated stickers to be converted to something viewable on Matrix.
* <span class="bridge-filter" bridges="telegram">**Bridges with voice messages**: </span>
  [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to transcode audio files (just install it with your system package manager).

## Production setup
Don't use `sudo` for any of these steps (and preferably don't use the root user either).

0. Create a directory for the bridge. **Do not clone the repository.**
1. Set up a virtual environment.
   1. Create with `virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 .` (note the dot at the end)
      * You should not use a subdirectory for the virtualenv in this production
        setup. The `pip install` step places some required files at the root of
        the environment.
   2. Activate with `source ./bin/activate`
2. Install the bridge with `pip install --upgrade mautrix-$bridge[all]`
   * `[all]` at the end will install all optional dependencies. **This includes
     end-to-bridge encryption, which requires libolm3.** See the
     [optional dependencies page](./optional-dependencies.md) for more info.
   * If you want the master branch instead of a release, use
     `pip install --upgrade mautrix-$bridge[all]@git+https://github.com/mautrix/$bridge.git`.
3. Copy `example-config.yaml` to `config.yaml`.
4. Update the config to your liking. See the [initial bridge config](../general/initial-config.md)
   page for recommendations.
5. Generate the appservice registration with `python -m mautrix_$bridge -g`.
   You can use the `-c` and `-r` flags to change the location of the config and
   registration files. They default to `config.yaml` and `registration.yaml`
   respectively.
6. Register the bridge on your homeserver (see [Registering appservices]).
7. Run the bridge `python -m mautrix_$bridge`.

[Registering appservices]: ../general/registering-appservices.md

### Upgrading (production setup)
0. Make sure you're in the virtualenv (`source ./bin/activate`).
   * Note: if you updated Python, you'll have to recreate the virtualenv
     to apply the update.
1. Run the bridge install command again (install step #2).

## Development setup
0. Clone the repository.
1. _Optional, but strongly recommended:_ Set up a virtual environment.
   1. Create with `virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 .venv`
   2. Activate with `source .venv/bin/activate`
2. Install dependencies with `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`
   * Optionally, add `-r optional-requirements.txt` to install optional
     dependencies. Some of the optional dependencies may need additional native
     packages. See the [optional dependencies page](./optional-dependencies.md)
     for more info.
3. Continue from step #3 of production setup.
4. For linting: `pip install -r dev-requirements.txt` to install Black, isort
   and pre-commit, then install the Git hook with `pre-commit install`. This
   will ensure that code is properly formatted when you commit, to avoid having
   to fix linting errors when the CI complains.

### Upgrading (development setup)
0. Make sure you're in the virtualenv (`source .venv/bin/activate`).
   * Note: if you updated Python, you'll have to recreate the virtualenv
     to apply the update.
1. Pull changes from Git.
2. Run the dependency install command again (install step #2).

## systemd service
1. Create a user for the bridge:
   ```shell
   $ sudo adduser --system mautrix-$bridge --home /opt/mautrix-$bridge
   ```
2. Follow the [production setup instructions](#production-setup) above.
   Make sure you use that user and home directory for the bridge.
4. Create a systemd service file at `/etc/systemd/system/mautrix-$bridge.service`:
   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=mautrix-$bridge bridge

   [Service]
   # N.B. If you didn't create a user with the correct home directory, set this
   #      to the directory where config.yaml is (e.g. /opt/mautrix-$bridge).
   WorkingDirectory=~
   ExecStart=/opt/mautrix-$bridge/bin/python -m mautrix_$bridge
   User=mautrix-$bridge

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```
