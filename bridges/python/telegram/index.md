# mautrix-telegram
Welcome to the mautrix-telegram docs!

Use the sidebar to find the relevant pages. Things that are the same for all
bridges, like setting up the bridge, are right below the "Python-based bridges"
header. Things specific to mautrix-telegram are under this page.

These docs are mostly targeted towards people who are hosting the bridge 
themselves. If you don't want to host it yourself, you can use a public 
instance. When using public instances, refer to their instructions and support 
rooms.
