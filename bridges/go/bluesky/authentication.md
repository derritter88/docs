# Authentication
0. Open a private chat with the bridge bot. Usually `@blueskybot:your.server`
   * If the bot doesn't accept the invite, see the [troubleshooting page](../../general/troubleshooting.md)
1. Send `login` to start the login.
2. Send your Bluesky PDS domain. If you aren't running your own PDS, you're
   probably using `bsky.social`.
3. Send your Bluesky account email address or handle (handles are domains like
   `username.bsky.social` or a custom domain that you connected to Bluesky).
4. Send your Bluesky account password. If you have 2-factor authentication,
   create an app-specific password.
5. The bot should inform you of a successful login and bridge recent chats.
